# Asyncon

Small project to learn and experiment with Python's Asyncio.

The goal is to grab favicon urls for the top sites listed on Alexa.com

This project spawned from wanting something more efficient than a bunch of Celery for loading these favicon URLs in [this project](http://github.com/patallen/favivind/).
